Very primitive recipe book for my wife. Which I don't have. But when I do, she
will use this.

Usage
-----

Write your recipes in `./src/$recipename.markdown`. First first-level heading
becomes recipe name.

Compile them by `./bin/compile` command.

Known bugs
----------

* On Windows with msysgit, Cyrillic file names may get screwed.

P.S.

If you make tasty cakes, send me some, please.
